Data
====

This section covers the documentation for various data processing modules within the PlantReactivityAnalysis project. These modules handle everything from data preparation to dataset generation.

Eurythmy Data Preparation
-------------------------
This module is responsible for preparing and cleaning the eurythmy data to make it ready for analysis.

.. automodule:: PlantReactivityAnalysis.data.preparation_eurythmy_data

Wav Reader
----------
This class is responsible for reading the signal data from the .wav files.

.. automodule:: PlantReactivityAnalysis.data.wav_data_reader
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
