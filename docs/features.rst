Features
========

This section covers the documentation for extracting and handling features within the PlantReactivityAnalysis project. It includes detailed descriptions of how features are extracted from waveforms and how datasets are prepared for modeling.

WAV Feature Extractor
---------------------
This class is responsible for extracting features from .wav files. These features might include various statistical or signal processing metrics that are critical for later analysis stages.
